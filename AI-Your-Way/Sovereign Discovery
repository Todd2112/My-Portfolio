Sovereign Legal Engine: Entry 01 in the Sovereign Series
"Local AI for High-Stakes Law—No APIs, No Data Leaks, No Compromises."

I built the Sovereign Legal Engine because the legal industry has a massive problem: they are being told that high-level AI reasoning only exists in the cloud. For a senior litigator or an appellate clerk, sending sensitive filings to a 3rd-party API isn't just a risk—it's a liability.

This isn't a "wrapper." It’s a precision-engineered audit tool that runs 100% on your own hardware. I designed it to bring "Zero Trust" intelligence directly to your desk.

Why I Built It
In my experience, legal documents are a nightmare for standard AI. Scanned PDFs, broken table structures, and complex formatting usually lead to garbled noise or, worse, hallucinations. I didn't want to build a tool that "guessed" at findings. I wanted an engine that verified the data before it ever hit the model.

Key Engineering Pillars
1. The Defensive Fallback Chain
I don't trust standard extraction. I built a multi-stage fallback system:

Structural Parsing: First, I try to extract high-fidelity tables and headers.

OCR Pivot: If the text density is too low or garbled, the engine automatically pivots to local OCR.

Verification: I implemented a quality-check layer. If the data isn't clean enough for a courtroom, the system stops. I'd rather give you no answer than a wrong one.

2. The Dual-Agent Pipeline (Auditor vs. Narrator)
I realized that asking one small model to do everything causes "context drift." To solve this, I split the "brain" into two specialized agents running in parallel on my local CPU:

The Auditor (Llama 3.2 3B): This agent is clinical. It focuses strictly on extracting Holdings, Rules, and Precedents into a structured JSON ledger.

The Narrator (Llama 3.2 1B): This agent handles the human side. It generates the brief and handles mission-keyword highlighting (like FSIA or Sovereign Immunity).

3. Zero-Chatter Sanitization
Local models love to "talk" and add conversational fluff. I built a custom sanitization layer that strips away the AI-ness. No "Sure, here's your analysis." You get the findings, the authority type, and the risk level. Period.

The Sovereign Specs
I’m a firm believer that you shouldn't need a server farm to run powerful AI.

Hardware: Tested and optimized for an M-series Mac or a modern laptop (16GB+ RAM).

Inference: Runs 100% locally via Ollama.

Privacy: Air-gapped capable. Your strategy and your data stay where they belong—under your control.

How I Use It
I’ve included a Logic Store in the engine. This allows me to swap out "mission profiles" instantly. Whether I'm doing a SCOTUS audit, a contract review, or a deposition summary, I just commit the new logic and the engine adapts.

Note: The Sovereign Legal Engine is a proprietary product. This repository serves as a technical showcase and architectural proof-of-work.
