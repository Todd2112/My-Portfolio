### **Phase 1: Brand & Copy Creation** (Powered by CopyIQ)

This is the foundation of your content. We use our **CopyIQ** pipeline to collaborate with you and create compelling, on-brand marketing copy.

* **You provide the vision:** Share your product details, brand voice, and campaign goals with us.
* **We generate and validate:** Our system produces a range of copy options, which we then rigorously validate. We use **Factual Overlap** to ensure every piece is consistent with your brand identity and **Hallucination Scores** to eliminate inaccuracies, protecting your brand's reputation.

**Outcome:** High-quality, brand-safe copy that builds authority from day one.

* **We refine with precision:** AI-powered rewriting ensures every word contributes to your SEO goals without risking keyword stuffing.

### **Phase 4: Social Media Optimization** (Powered by SMO Agent)

The final stage in the suite ensures your content performs brilliantly on social media. **SMO Agent** converts your content into **platform-perfect posts** for Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Instagram, and Facebook.

* **Standalone or Integrated:** Use SMO Agent independently or automatically pull content from CopyIQ, Max SEO, and LLMO for end-to-end optimization.
* **Platform-Aware Optimization:** Tailors content length, tone, hashtags, and calls-to-action for each social platform.
* **Smart Hashtags:** Deduped, relevant hashtags automatically generated.
* **One-Click Copy:** Easily copy optimized posts for immediate publishing.
* **Track & Export:** Save posts, edit them, and export in CSV or JSON.

**Outcome:** Engaging, ready-to-publish social media content optimized for reach and engagement.
