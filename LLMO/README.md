Recent data highlights this shift:

- **ChatGPT's Rapid Growth:** In 2024, ChatGPT handled an estimated 37.5 million search-like prompts per day, a significant increase from previous years. ([searchengineland.com](https://searchengineland.com/google-search-bigger-chatgpt-search-453142?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

- **User Behavior Shifts:** A survey revealed that 77% of U.S. users have utilized ChatGPT as a search engine, with 24% preferring it over traditional search engines for information retrieval.
