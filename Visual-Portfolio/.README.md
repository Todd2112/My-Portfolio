# 🎨 AI Character Identity & Style Showcase

Welcome! This portfolio showcases my ability to generate **visually consistent characters** across a variety of **photorealistic and stylized formats** using advanced AI pipelines.

Each render is based on a real individual whose identity was locked using a custom-trained LoRA model. From there, I applied style-specific prompt engineering to simulate both DSLR realism and artistic visual styles.

## 💼 What This Demonstrates

- ✅ **Identity Locking:** Same character across all styles and scenes
- ✅ **Photographic Control:** Real DSLR camera simulation (f-stop, lens, brand)
- ✅ **Style Versatility:** From Pixar to Noir to commercial headshots
- ✅ **Freelance Ready:** Fast, lean pipeline designed for client delivery
