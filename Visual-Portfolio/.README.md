# AI Identity Replication Pipeline  
_Real Faces. Real Structure. Real Control._  

This portfolio showcases a fully offline, forensic-grade AI pipeline for replicating facial identity across diverse environments, lighting, and styles — using just a single source image.

We built this system to **recover, preserve, and stylize real human identity** using adaptive training and dynamic rendering — without reliance on cloud APIs, and without falling into stylization drift or feature hallucination.

---

## 🔬 Why This Matters

In most AI pipelines, faces become softened, idealized, or outright replaced with synthetic beauty norms. This system does the opposite:  
It **locks identity from real images**, and **renders consistent outputs** in new contexts while retaining structural integrity — bone geometry, eye spacing, jawline, skin age, and detail fidelity.

---

## 🧩 Pipeline Overview

1. Image Prep       → remove bg, detect face, crop, resize  
2. Augmentation     → rotation + scaled center crops  
3. Embedding        → 512-D reference vector for identity lock  
4. LoRA Training    → 4-phase adaptive convergence  
5. Seed Discovery   → cosine drift scored over multiple seeds  
6. Stylized Inference → 3-phase or 2-pass rendering  

Each stage is designed for minimal image input, zero cloud calls, and maximum identity fidelity.

## 📸 Visual Evolution Timeline  
_Tracking identity fidelity from raw photo to stylized results_

This section demonstrates how our pipeline evolves a single source image into multiple rendered identities — **without ever losing facial lock**. Each image was generated at a different phase of the system, documenting the transformation from raw photo to stylized outputs.

### ✂️ Cropped & Cleaned for Training

![Cropped Face](https://github.com/Todd2112/My-Portfolio/blob/master/Visual-Portfolio/orig_woman_face_768_crop1_80.png)  
> Background removed, face-cropped, and resized to 768x768.  
> This becomes our **sole training input**, preserving structural identity.

### 🎯 Seed Generation (Drift-Scored Identity Match)

![Seed Gen Output](https://github.com/Todd2112/My-Portfolio/blob/master/Visual-Portfolio/seed_gen.png)  
> We evaluate generated outputs from different seeds, measuring **cosine drift** between embeddings.  
> ✅ *Drift score: 0.1621 (locked)*  
> 🔑 *Seed: 1187891159*

### ⚠️ Inference Error – Over-smoothing & Facial Drift

![Inference Over-smoothed](https://github.com/Todd2112/My-Portfolio/blob/master/Visual-Portfolio/Nikon_younger.png)  
> Early inference attempts de-aged the subject and introduced skin smoothing.  
> Visually clean, but **forensically incorrect** — facial parity was lost.

### ✅ Stylizer Success – Rooftop Scene (Hair Variant)

> Rooftop scene with different hair style and soft natural lighting.  
> ✅ *Identity match confirmed*  
> 🌀 *Wind and pose changes introduced without losing structure*

### ✅ Stylizer Success – Beach Scene (Identity Locked)

> The **exact same woman**, now placed in a golden-hour beach environment.  
> 🔒 *Facial features, expression, and skin age remain consistent.*

### 🧒 Controlled De-aging – Youthful Variant

### 🧑‍🎨 Hair Color Change – Identity Unchanged

### 🔐 Final Observation

Despite scene changes, pose shifts, lighting variations, and aesthetic transformations:

> **The woman remains the same.**  
> _Structure locked. Expression anchored. Identity intact._

| 🔹 Cropped Variant | Center crop for facial reinforcement (60%)      |
| 🔹 Identity Locked | Best result from cosine drift scoring loop      |
| 🔹 Stylized – Beach| Natural hair, lighting, and outdoor texture     |
| 🔹 Stylized – Rooftop| Urban scene, soft wind, sunset gradient      |
| 🔹 Stylized – Field| Golden hour, motion-blurred linen, 85mm lens    |

## 🧬 Identity Vector Embedding

Using a 512-D facial embedding network trained on real-world human geometry, we convert each prepared image into a numerical anchor. This vector is used to measure identity drift after generation.

```
drift = cosine(reference_embedding, generated_embedding)
```

We consider drift ≤ 0.18 to be “locked.”

## 🏋️ Training with Adaptive Convergence

Rather than rely on fixed step counts, we built a multi-phase training engine with real-time statistical convergence logic.

| Phase      | LR     | Alpha | Loss         | Optimizer |
|------------|--------|-------|--------------|-----------|
| COARSE     | 1e-4   | 8     | MSE          | AdamW     |
| MID        | 3e-5   | 4     | Huber        | AdamW     |
| MID_FINE   | 1e-6   | 2     | Charbonnier  | AdamP     |
| FINAL_FINE | 5e-7   | 1     | Charbonnier  | AdamP     |

### Convergence is detected via:
- Welford tracking of loss mean/variance  
- Sliding window slope analysis  
- Plateau detection (statistical p-value threshold)  

Example:  
> Exiting FINAL_FINE after 4 iterations (slope plateau detected).  
> LoRA saved to: /lora_weights/unet_lora

---

## 🎯 Seed Selection (Cosine Drift Verification)

After training, we pass the face back through rendering using different seed values, then compare each result to the original face vector. This ensures that the facial structure hasn't been lost or stylized away.

Example:
> Drift: 0.1621 | Seed: 1187891159  
> ✅ Saved: verify_seed_1187891159_drift_0.1621.png

---

## 🎨 Stylized Inference (3-Pass Rendering)

The final render is produced using a dynamic, GUI-driven image-to-image pipeline that:
- Locks identity with Phase 1 (LoRA)
- Applies scene prompts in Phase 2
- Stylizes gently in Phase 3
- Optionally blends back toward realism

| Phase     | Alpha | CFG  | Notes                            |
|-----------|--------|------|----------------------------------|
| Phase 1   | 1.0    | 5.8  | Identity lock                    |
| Phase 2   | 0.85   | 6.3  | Scene-specific composition       |
| Phase 3   | 0.90   | 6.8  | Final realism + Rescue (30%)     |

Example prompts:
- “Spa garden at dusk, candle-lit, 85mm, f/2.8”  
- “Urban rooftop, natural light, shallow depth”

---

## ⚡ Alternate Stylizer (2-Pass Export Mode)

For fast rendering or portrait exports, we use a simplified two-stage stylizer:
- Stable Diffusion-based anchor using LoRA  
- High-fidelity stylizer with realism base  

This version logs all prompt metadata and is ideal for final deliverables.
