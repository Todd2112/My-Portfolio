# AI Identity Replication Pipeline  
_Real Faces. Real Structure. Real Control._  

This portfolio showcases a fully offline, forensic-grade AI pipeline for replicating facial identity across diverse environments, lighting, and styles â€” using just a single source image.

We built this system to **recover, preserve, and stylize real human identity** using adaptive training and dynamic rendering â€” without reliance on cloud APIs, and without falling into stylization drift or feature hallucination.

## ðŸ”¬ Why This Matters

In most AI pipelines, faces become softened, idealized, or outright replaced with synthetic beauty norms. This system does the opposite:  
It **locks identity from real images**, and **renders consistent outputs** in new contexts while retaining structural integrity â€” bone geometry, eye spacing, jawline, skin age, and detail fidelity.

## ðŸ§© Pipeline Overview

```text
1. Image Prep       â†’ remove bg, detect face, crop, resize
2. Augmentation     â†’ rotation + scaled center crops
3. Embedding        â†’ 512-D reference vector for identity lock
4. LoRA Training    â†’ 4-phase adaptive convergence
5. Seed Discovery   â†’ cosine drift scored over multiple seeds
6. Stylized Inference â†’ 3-phase or 2-pass rendering
