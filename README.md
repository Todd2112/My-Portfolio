# 🚀 Todd2112's Dev Portfolio

Welcome! This portfolio showcases a collection of applications I’ve built and deployed using **Python**, **Streamlit**, **FastAPI**, **Ollama**, **LangChain**, and **MCP**. These apps are hosted on free-tier platforms for **informational and demonstration purposes only**—they're not commercial products.

Here, I focus on showing what I can **design, develop, and deploy independently**, using lightweight tools to get ideas onto the web as examples of **proof of concepts**, **NOT** intended as production enviroments .
This repo is the hub for my projects focused on:

- 🧠 Reasoning-based AI
- 🕵️‍♂️ Security & cyber forensics
- 🧰 Automation tools
- 🕸️ Web scraping & analysis

## 🔍 Featured Projects
