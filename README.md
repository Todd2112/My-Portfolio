# 🚀 Todd2112's Dev Portfolio

Welcome! This portfolio showcases a collection of applications I’ve built and deployed using **Python**, **Streamlit**, **FastAPI**, **Ollama**, **LangChain**, and **MCP**. These apps are hosted on free-tier platforms for **informational and demonstration purposes only**—they are not commercial products.

The goal here is to demonstrate what I can **design, develop, and deploy independently**, using lightweight tools to get ideas online quickly. These are **proof-of-concept projects**, not production environments. This repo serves as a hub for my work focused on:


- 🧠 Reasoning-based AI
- 🕵️‍♂️ Security & cyber forensics
- 🧰 Automation tools
- 🕸️ Web scraping & analysis

## 🔍 Featured Projects

### 📌 [Web Keyword Crawler](https://web-keyword.streamlit.app/)
An app that recursively scrapes websites, searches for specific keywords, and displays matches in real time. 

- ✅ Streamlit UI (no terminal input)
- 🔍 Internal link crawling
- ⚡ Built for speed, UX, and diagnostics
- 🌐 Powered by the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
