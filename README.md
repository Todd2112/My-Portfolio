# 🤖 Reasoning AI Chatbot (Portfolio Demo)

Welcome to my **Reasoning AI Chatbot!**  
This app simulates how an intelligent assistant reasons through your questions — showing both its thought process and final answers.

## 🚀 Live Demo for HR Reviewers

_**Tip:** Right-click or Ctrl+Click to open in a new tab!_

Demo Mode gives you a frictionless experience. It mimics how the AI would respond using logical reasoning — even without a large language model installed.
