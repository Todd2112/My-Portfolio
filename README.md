# My Portfolio

I'm building AI systems with one guiding principle: AI belongs to the users, not to corporations.

Today’s dominant platforms — OpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft, Google — keep AI locked behind APIs, subscriptions, and terms of service that restrict freedom and compromise privacy. They turn intelligence into a product you rent, never own.

My work takes AI back out of the cloud and puts it in your hands. I design and develop local, private, adaptive AI pipelines that run on your hardware, with your data, under your control. No corporate middlemen, no hidden costs, no black-box restrictions.

This portfolio showcases **proof-of-concept projects** demonstrating real-world AI, adaptive LLM, and intelligent software solutions.

My work emphasizes **offline deployment, privacy, and adaptive AI** that is trained to work for your specific business context — **no cloud dependencies, no subscription fees, no prompt engineering guesswork**.

Unlike SaaS AI services promoted by OpenAI, Microsoft, or others — which prioritize recurring revenue over user value — my focus is on delivering local, adaptive AI that works for your business, efficiently, privately, and securely.

## Why Local Adaptive AI Matters

When you rely on subscription-based AI, your proprietary data is stored, analyzed, and leveraged by third parties. Cancel your subscription, and any models fine-tuned on your workflows vanish. Worse, your sensitive information can indirectly influence generalized LLMs, leaving you exposed.

My local adaptive AI pipelines ensure:

- Complete data privacy and offline operation
- AI that learns and grows with your business
- Compatibility with your existing tools (a private MS Office-style equivalent)
- Scalable integration across departments, workflows, and industries

Just as businesses modernized with computers, paperless systems, and Microsoft Office, adaptive AI is now foundational for efficiency, automation, competitive intelligence, and innovation. My approach eliminates middlemen, SaaS dependency, and recurring costs.

## Hardware-Aware Deployment

I design AI pipelines that scale to your hardware, from CPU-only laptops to local GPU servers:

- Small-business-ready LLMs and AI pipelines without expensive GPUs
- Stable Diffusion for visual replication, generative design, and prototyping
- Reasoning AI, RAG search, and NLP pipelines optimized for both CPUs and GPUs
- Future-proof, multi-platform deployment that grows with your infrastructure
- Full offline operation to maximize privacy, security, and compliance
