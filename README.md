# 🚀 Todd2112's Dev Portfolio

Welcome! This portfolio showcases a collection of applications I’ve built and deployed using **Python**, **Streamlit**, **FastAPI**, **Ollama**, **LangChain**, and **MCP**. These apps are hosted on free-tier platforms for **informational and demonstration purposes only**—they are not commercial products.

The goal here is to demonstrate what I can **design, develop, and deploy independently**, using lightweight tools to get ideas online quickly. These are **proof-of-concept projects**, not production environments. This repo serves as a hub for my work focused on:


- 🧠 Reasoning-based AI
- 🕵️‍♂️ Security & cyber forensics
- 🧰 Automation tools
- 🕸️ Web scraping & analysis

## 🔍 Featured Projects

### 📌 [Web Keyword Crawler](https://web-keyword.streamlit.app/)
A blazing-fast Streamlit app that scrapes public websites for specific keywords, with optional recursive crawling and readable match context.

**Highlights:**
- 🌐 Scrapes public websites for keyword matches  
- 🔗 Recursively crawls internal links (depth configurable)  
- 📄 Clean, readable context for each match  
- ⚡ Fast, distraction-free: no ads, no trackers, just results

**Built With:**
- 🐍 Python + Streamlit UI (zero terminal input)
- 🧠 Modular code powered by the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**
- 🕸️ Web scraping via `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`
- 🧱 Designed with reusable functions and single-responsibility principles

### 🧠 [Reasoning Chatbot](./reasoning-ai-chatbot/)
An intelligent chatbot that explains its reasoning process step-by-step. Think of it as Sherlock Holmes with an LLM.

- 🗣️ Interactive interface (Streamlit)
- 🔎 Transparent logic path
- 🧰 Ideal for interviews, training, and explainability demos
