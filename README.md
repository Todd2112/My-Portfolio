# 🧠 My Portfolio

This portfolio showcases a series of **proof-of-concept projects** focused on solving real-world problems through AI, cybersecurity, and intelligent software design.

Each project represents an exploration of how lightweight tools can be used to **rapidly design, develop, and deploy** solutions that address practical challenges.  
All applications are hosted on free-tier platforms for **informational and demonstration purposes only**.

This portfolio is a **statement of engineering philosophy**:  
Clear problem definition.  
Targeted solutions.  
Methodical execution.

---

## 🔬 Statement of Intent

**We are not building production-grade products here.**  
We are demonstrating that complex, real-world problems can be addressed through focused prototypes, built with accessible tools, under clear constraints.

Our approach emphasizes:

- Clarity of purpose
- Technical rigor
- Ethical, responsible coding practices
- Practical awareness of limitations and trade-offs

## 🛠 Featured Projects

### 📌 [Web Keyword Crawler](https://web-keyword.streamlit.app/)
(click link above to see it in action)

**Problem:**  
Organizations need to monitor external websites for specific mentions without getting trapped by trackers, ads, or dynamic web content.

**Solution:**  
A lightweight web crawler that rapidly and anonymously retrieves static HTML, filters it for targeted keywords, and presents clean context around each match.

**Applications:**  
- Brand monitoring
- Competitive intelligence
- Research aggregation

### 🧠 [Reasoning AI Chatbot](https://todd2112.github.io/My-Portfolio/live-demo.html)
(click the link above to see an actual question/answer demo)

**Problem:**  
LLMs often provide answers without transparent reasoning, making it difficult to verify or trust the output.

**Solution:**  
An interactive chatbot that explicitly displays its step-by-step reasoning path, offering users visibility into the logic behind the response.

**Applications:**  
- Explainable AI prototypes
- Interview or training simulations
- Decision support tools

### 🕵️‍♂️ [Sherlock Holmes AI Agent](./sherlock-holmes-ai/)

**Overview - Proof of Concept**

This project explores how lightweight AI agents can be designed to perform **thematic analysis**, **logical inference**, and **knowledge extraction** across large text documents.  
Modeled after the deductive methods of Sherlock Holmes, this agent demonstrates a novel approach to **parsing**, **linking**, and **summarizing** critical information scattered across unstructured content.

While initially demonstrated on literary works in the public domain, the framework generalizes to professional fields like **data science**, **document intelligence**, and **knowledge management**.

---

**Problem Statement**

Professionals often struggle with locating nuanced insights hidden deep within massive text-based resources.  
Simple keyword searches miss the **context**, **intent**, and **connections** crucial for real understanding.

The **challenge** addressed by this project is:  
> *"How can we intelligently extract and reason about information in unstructured data — seeing not just where facts occur, but how they relate and evolve?"*

---

**Approach**

The Sherlock Holmes AI Agent is designed to:

- **Parse** and **analyze** large text documents (e.g., books, manuals, research papers)
- **Identify entities** (characters, concepts, themes)
- **Link references** across sections to build logical inferences
- **Summarize** key patterns and reasoning paths
- **Learn** and **improve** over time using lightweight neural network models

From a **data science** perspective, it applies:

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** for structured parsing
- **Information Retrieval** for focused extraction
- **Pattern Recognition** for connecting scattered references
- **Explainable AI** techniques to present logical reasoning paths

---

**Potential Applications**

- Intelligent document indexing
- Legal discovery and contract review
- Research and academic summarization
- Knowledge graph generation
- AI training dataset construction

---

**Future Directions**

- Build modular neural networks for reasoning pattern recognition
- Train lightweight text embeddings to model relationships across documents
- Expand to handle PDFs, Word Docs, and scanned files via OCR
- Integrate with modular LLMs where heavy inference is feasible (e.g., local/private servers)
