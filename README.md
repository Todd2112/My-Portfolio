# 🤖 Reasoning AI Chatbot (Portfolio Demo)

Welcome to my Reasoning AI Chatbot! This app simulates how an intelligent AI assistant thinks through your questions — showing both the reasoning process and answers.

## 🚀 Live Demo for HR Reviewers

🚀 [Click here to try the app (Demo Mode only)](https://my-portfolio-reasoning-ai.streamlit.app)  
_(Right-click or Ctrl+click to open in a new tab!)_


Demo Mode gives you a frictionless experience. It mimics how the AI would respond using reasoning logic — even without a large language model installed.
