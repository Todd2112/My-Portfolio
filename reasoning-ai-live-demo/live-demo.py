question = "write a simple print statement"

<think> Okay, so I need to write a simple print statement in Python. Let me think about how to do that.
First, I remember that printing is done using the print() function. So I should start by calling print followed by an argument inside parentheses.

What type of argument should I use? Since it's a simple example, maybe just a number or a string would work. Let me pick a number first.

So the code should look like print(5). That way, when I run this line, it will output 5 on the screen.

Wait, but sometimes people might want to see a message instead of a number. Like print("Hello World"). But for a simple case, maybe just using a number is enough and easier to understand.

Let me test this in my mind. If I type print(5), does it display 5? Yes, that's correct.

Is there anything else I need to consider? Maybe using different data types like strings or booleans could be explored later, but for now, sticking to a number should suffice.

So putting it all together, the code will be:

print(5)

I think that's straightforward. It's clear and meets the requirement of writing a simple print statement. </think>

**Reasoning**: To print a number in Python, use the `print()` function with an integer or string as the argument inside parentheses.

**Code**:
```python
print(5)
