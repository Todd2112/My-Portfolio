## What This Is (In Plain English)

This project implements a fully local AI assistant with persistent memory,
designed to replace cloud-based tools like ChatGPT for real engineering work.

It:
- Remembers work across days and weeks
- Never sends data to third parties
- Uses retrieval instead of guessing
- Runs entirely on consumer hardware
- Has zero ongoing costs

This is not a chatbot.
It is an AI system designed for correctness, auditability, and ownership.
