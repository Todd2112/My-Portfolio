# Your AI, Your Way
# Human-In-The-Loop LLM Training

I've developed a **modular AI platform** that solves the biggest flaws of traditional AI services and subscription-based models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT. This system puts **your data, your expertise, and your company first**, without handing over control to third-party providers.

## What This Is — And What It Is Not

**This is:**  
- A **turnkey AI solution** that ingests your data (PDFs, Word docs, URLs, or manual input), generates training Q&A, and lets your experts guide the AI to produce accurate, reliable results.  
- **Fast deployment** with a web-browser interface, making it intuitive for your team to use.  
- **LLM agnostic:** Works on modern CPUs and GPUs, on laptops, desktops, or servers — without locking you into a specific vendor or subscription.  
- **One-time setup:** I get your system operational and train your team — that’s it.  

**This is not:**  
- 24/7 tech support, virus removal, or troubleshooting of unrelated system issues.  
- A subscription-based service that locks your data or AI knowledge behind monthly fees.  
- A custom solution for outdated or unsupported systems (e.g., Windows 98, underpowered CPUs, or virus-riddled machines).  

> **If your system does not meet the minimum requirements, this service is not a fit.**

## Why This Matters

### Your Data, Your Control
Most AI services **collect and reuse your input data by design**. Cancel your subscription, and you lose access to all the AI’s knowledge. **Not here. You own it all.**

### No Magic Pill
There’s **no one-size-fits-all AI solution**. This system gives you **true custom AI**, controlled by your team, for your company’s knowledge.

### AI Isn’t Magic — Human-in-the-Loop is Essential
AI **hallucinates and produces errors**. My system uses **Human-in-the-Loop (HIL) training** to ensure outputs are **accurate, relevant, and aligned with your business knowledge**.

### Flexible Training & Continuous Learning
Train on **anything** — PDFs, Word docs, URLs, or manual input. The system **learns continuously**, keeping AI up-to-date with your current policies, processes, and expert knowledge.

## Scalable & Accessible Infrastructure

You **don’t need massive servers or GPUs** to start. My platform runs on **any modern laptop or desktop** with sufficient memory and storage. As your business grows, the system **scales seamlessly** — from a single laptop to full servers with GPUs — delivering **secure, efficient, and high-performance AI assistance** at every stage.

## Key Benefits

- **Data Sovereignty:** Full ownership of all AI knowledge; nothing leaves your system unless you allow it.  
- **Scalable AI:** Adapts to small setups or enterprise-grade deployments.  
- **Human-in-the-Loop Accuracy:** Expert-guided training eliminates hallucinations.  
- **Continuous Learning:** AI evolves with your business automatically.  
- **Cross-Platform Training:** Ingest documents, URLs, or manual entries for **robust, modular learning**.  
- **Quick Deployment:** One-time setup and training; future upgrades are a separate engagement.

## Minimum Requirements

- **OS:** Windows 10/11, Linux, or macOS (64-bit recommended)  
- **RAM:** 8GB minimum (16GB+ recommended for larger datasets)  
- **Storage:** 20GB free disk space minimum  
- **CPU/GPU:** Must be able to run the quantized LLM included in the scripts  
- **Browser:** Modern web browser for GUI interface  

> Systems not meeting these requirements will **not be supported**. I do **not troubleshoot unrelated system issues or clean viruses**.

## How It Works

1. Input your data (docs, PDFs, URLs).  
2. System ingests and generates Q&A pairs.  
3. You review, edit, or reject Q&A items.  
4. The AI trains under your supervision using Human-in-the-Loop guidance.  
5. Your team has an **operational, accurate, and private AI**, ready to assist immediately.

**Fast, independent, and professional. I come in, set it up, train your team, and I’m out. No subscriptions, no hidden costs, no soul-crushing tech support.**
