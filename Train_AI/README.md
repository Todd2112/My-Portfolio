# Your AI, Your Way
# Human-In-The-Loop LLM Training

I've developed a **modular AI platform** that solves the biggest flaws of traditional AI services and subscription-based models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT. This system puts **your data, your expertise, and your company first**, without handing over control to third-party providers.

## What This Is — And What It Is Not

This system is designed for **simplicity, autonomy, and flexibility**:

- **It is:** A locally running, modular AI platform that can learn from your documents, URLs, or manual input.  
- **It is not:** A subscription-based service, cloud-dependent system, or 24/7 tech support contract.  
- **You get:** A one-time setup walkthrough, demonstration of usage, and co-created deployment tuned to your computing setup. Once it’s running, it’s **yours** — I’m out.

> If your system isn’t capable of running the models we select (CPU, RAM, OS), the project can’t proceed — this keeps expectations clear and avoids wasted time.

## Why This Matters

### Your Data, Your Control
Most AI services **collect and reuse your input data** to “customize your experience.” That means they **build profiles on you or your company**, monetize your data, or use it to improve their models — while you pay monthly. **Cancel your subscription, and you lose all the knowledge the AI has learned.** Not here. Your AI is **100% local and fully owned by you**.

### LLM-Agnostic
This system works with **multiple large language models** — you’re **not locked into a single provider**. Choose a model that matches your system’s computing power, whether CPU-only or GPU-accelerated.

### Web Browser GUI
The interface runs in any **modern web browser**, making it **intuitive and easy to use**. If you can read a screen and type into a box, you can operate this system.

### Human-in-the-Loop Accuracy
AI **hallucinates and returns flawed responses**. This platform uses **Human-in-the-Loop (HIL) training**, letting you **accept, edit, or reject questions and answers** during setup and day-to-day use. The AI **learns from your corrections**, evolving safely under your guidance.

### Flexible Training & Continuous Learning
Train on **anything**: PDFs, Word docs, URLs, or manual entries. The system **adapts continuously**, reflecting your **current processes, policies, and expert knowledge** without retraining from scratch.

## Custom-Tailored Deployment

I consult with you upfront to **evaluate your system and co-create the deployment**. This ensures that the AI:

- Is **custom-tailored to your computing power and OS**  
- Operates **locally and efficiently**  
- Provides **accurate, usable outputs from day one**  

Once deployed, the system is **yours to use independently** — no ongoing support or hidden subscriptions. You’re hiring **a freelancer to deliver a tailored solution**, not a monthly albatross like ChatGPT or other subscription-based AI services.

## Your AI. Your Way.

Sure, AI services like ChatGPT can tell you **what the capital of Texas is** or **what wine pairs with chicken**. But that’s not what this system is for.  

This platform is designed for **your business, your processes, your knowledge** — not trivia or generic advice. It’s about giving you **a tool that adapts to your expertise**, grows with your business, and **learns from you directly**, not from someone else’s dataset. This system is built from the ground up to be trained **specifically on your needs**, not what some general AI thinks you need, but **exactly what you need**.

---

## No Corporate Hype, Just Your AI

I’m not Google, OpenAI, or Facebook. This system **doesn’t collect your data, require subscriptions, or tie you to a cloud service**. You get **a working, locally running AI platform tailored to your needs**, with no unnecessary extras. Once we’ve built and deployed it together, it’s **yours to use independently** — no ongoing support obligations, no hidden commitments, no AI marketing hype.

## Key Benefits

- **Data Sovereignty:** You keep full ownership; nothing leaves your system unless you allow it.  
- **Mercenary Deployment:** I set it up, walk you through usage, and leave — no long-term obligations.  
- **LLM Flexibility:** Choose from multiple models to suit your hardware.  
- **Human-in-the-Loop Accuracy:** Guide AI learning for precise, business-aligned outputs.  
- **Web Browser Interface:** Intuitive, universal access without complex installs.  
- **Continuous Learning:** The AI evolves with your business, reflecting the latest input from you.  
- **Cross-Platform Training:** Ingest documents, URLs, or manual entries for **robust, modular learning**.
