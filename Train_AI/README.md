# Your AI, Your Way
# Human-In-The-Loop LLM Training

I've developed a **modular AI platform** that solves the biggest flaws of traditional AI services and subscription-based models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT. This system puts **your data, your expertise, and your company first**, without handing over control to third-party providers.

## What This Is — And What It Is Not

**This system IS:**
- **LLM-agnostic:** Works with multiple large language models — you’re not locked into one provider.  
- **Web-browser interface:** Intuitive, easy to use — anyone familiar with a browser can operate it.  
- **Simple to train and use:** Accept, edit, or reject AI-generated questions and answers; the system learns from your input.  
- **Mercenary-style setup:** I **walk you through setup and show you how it works**, then I’m out. You keep full control; no ongoing support, no subscriptions, no implied obligations.

**This system is NOT:**
- A subscription service requiring ongoing payments or updates.  
- A 24/7 tech support or IT troubleshooting service.  
- A guarantee that I will fix unrelated hardware, OS, or virus issues.  
- A product that runs on unsupported or obsolete systems — your computer must meet minimum requirements to run the AI.

> **Bottom line:** If you don’t have a system capable of running the provided LLM scripts, I **cannot** take the job.

## Why This Matters

### Your Data, Your Control
Most AI services **collect and reuse your input data by design** to “customize your experience.” In plain terms: they **build profiles on you or your company**, monetize your data, or use it to improve their models — while you pay monthly for the privilege. **Cancel your subscription, and you lose access to all the AI’s knowledge**, leaving your business without the work it trained on.

### No Magic Pill
There is **no magic pill, powder, or potion** — no one-size-fits-all solution that advertisers and marketing directors go on TV to sell you about AI. Those “customized user experiences” are marketing hype. **You want a true custom AI experience? You have to build it yourself. I give you that power.**

### AI Isn’t Magic — Human-in-the-Loop is Essential
AI **hallucinates, returns flawed responses, and doesn’t actually think**. My system uses **Human-in-the-Loop (HIL) training**, where your experts guide the AI, ensuring all outputs are **accurate, relevant, and aligned with your business knowledge**. Garbage in = garbage out? **Not here. Your AI evolves safely and intelligently under your supervision.**

### Flexible Training & Continuous Learning
Train on **anything** — PDFs, Word docs, website URLs, or even manual input. The system **learns continuously**, adapting as your business evolves. Your AI always reflects **current processes, policies, and expert knowledge**, keeping it **robust, intelligent, and reliable**.

---

## Easy to Use
The system is **designed for simplicity**. During training, it presents suggested questions and answers from your data — you can **accept, edit, or reject** each one. In day-to-day use, the AI continues to learn from your corrections, ensuring **accurate, up-to-date answers**.

## Scalable & Accessible Infrastructure
You **don’t need massive servers or GPUs** to get started. My platform runs on **any modern laptop or desktop** with sufficient memory and storage. As your business grows, the system **scales seamlessly** — from a single laptop to full servers with GPUs — delivering **secure, efficient, and high-performance AI assistance** at every stage.

- **Browser-Based GUI:** Intuitive interface for anyone familiar with standard web browsers.  
- **Mercenary Setup:** I **walk you through setup**, show you how it works, and I’m out — no long-term support obligations.
