# Web Keyword Crawler

## Overview - Proof of Concept

This project demonstrates a practical method for **programmatically extracting keyword-specific information** from publicly accessible websites.  
It serves as a **proof of concept** for building lightweight reconnaissance tools capable of cutting through web clutter and retrieving targeted content.

Developed as part of a broader engineering portfolio, this project highlights the ability to design, develop, and deploy custom data extraction solutions for real-world applications.

## Problem Statement

Organizations often require ways to monitor external websites for mentions of their brands, products, or relevant topics.  
Traditional browsing methods introduce inefficiencies due to advertisements, trackers, and dynamic content rendering.

The **challenge** addressed by this project is:  
> *"How can we rapidly and quietly extract meaningful textual content from websites without getting entangled in ads, popups, or JavaScript-heavy pages?"*

---

## Approach

This solution utilizes **direct HTTP requests** to retrieve static HTML content, avoiding browser emulation and JavaScript execution.  
By not requiring any user-specific data or interacting with cookies, this tool is designed to perform **anonymous searches**, ensuring that the process of gathering information doesn't trigger ads, trackers, or dynamic content rendering. 

The extracted content is parsed and filtered based on user-defined keyword sets.

Key techniques applied:

- **Request Handling:** Robust fetching with retry logic and custom headers to mimic human browsing patterns.
- **HTML Parsing:** Structured traversal using `lxml` and XPath expressions.
- **Recursive Crawling:** Depth-limited internal link exploration for broader coverage without overloading sites.
- **Keyword Filtering:** Isolation of content snippets containing target terms.
- **User Feedback Loop:** Mechanism for manually labeling results for future model training (optional).

Logging and error handling are implemented to ensure traceability and resilience.

## Potential Applications

Although developed as a proof of concept, this framework could be extended into production-ready systems for:

- Brand reputation monitoring
- Competitive landscape analysis
- Early warning systems for public relations
- Research aggregation in academia or journalism

---

## Limitations

This prototype focuses strictly on **static** HTML content retrieval. It does not:

- Render JavaScript-based dynamic content
- Interact with APIs, forms, or authentication systems
- Output structured reports (e.g., CSV or Excel formats)

Future iterations could incorporate headless browsing (e.g., `Selenium`, `Playwright`) for enhanced coverage.
