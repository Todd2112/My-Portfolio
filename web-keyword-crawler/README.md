## 🎯 What Makes This App Different?

Unlike traditional web scrapers or browser-based tools, this crawler goes straight to the source — raw HTML.

- ✅ **Ad-Free Experience:** Since the app doesn’t render JavaScript, it skips ads, popups, and trackers entirely.
- 🧠 **Minimalist & Focused:** It only returns relevant content that matches your keywords — nothing else.
- 🛡️ **Private & Stealthy:** It doesn’t trigger ad logic or cookie popups, and doesn’t track or store user activity.

Think of it as a reconnaissance tool for the web. Fast. Clean. Quiet.

> “You’re not surfing the web — you’re cutting through it like a hot knife through butter.”
